# Fullstack App built with NextJS in TypeScript

My intention with this app was to build a fullstack application to teach myself TypeScript, and some other cool tools I've kept my eye on for a while - Prisma, RTK and Chakra UI most importantly.

This project was bootstrapped with [this example project] (https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes-auth) which included some of the tools I wanted to try out.
