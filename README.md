# Fullstack App built with NextJS in TypeScript

My intention with this app was to build a fullstack application to teach myself TypeScript, and some other cool tools I've kept my eye on for a while - Prisma, RTK and Chakra UI most importantly.

The problem I wanted to solve with the app is to make it easier to plan a week of grocery shopping. It is basically a fancy shuffle function that shows you different recipes and you pick the ones you like. When you are happy with the recipes you have selected, you can then create a list of all the ingredients that you need for the recipes. 

To populate my database of recipes I am using a scraper to fetch recipe urls and get the necessary information from there.

This app is intended for personal use only ✌️
